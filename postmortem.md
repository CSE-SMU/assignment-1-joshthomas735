# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
	I have tooled around with front end development to a small extent in my free time, but nothing 
	too intense. Ive taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and some JQuery (CodeCademy is wonderful)


## How difficult was this assignment?
	The walkthrough made this assignment very straight forward not difficult


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
	Technically no, but I got a good refresher on JQuery and dusted the cobwebs off 
	my memory of all this stuff


## How could this assignment be improved?
	Since this is a basic assignment that I assume is designed to break in our coding muscles during the first week of class, I think the straightforward nature of the assignment is good and doesn't need much tweaking


## Any other comments?
	Nope
